Above is my first MySQL project and one I had a lot of fun with. It encapsulates a database I manually created and the subsequent initial exploratory 
analysis, as well as a thorough analysis to uncover any interesting trends (loads). The script includes an array of comments that explain the 
reasoning for specific lines of code and more importantly, the findings extracted from the aforementioned transactions. I also managed to formualate 
an EER diagram that highlights the relationships between all created tables. 

Interesting Insights:

    - Europe is the only continent that experienced a reduction/improvement in Unemployment from 2015-2020.

    - 80% of countries in this data table experienced worsened Unemployment post the 2008 GFC, with Denmark 
      leading the way (an almost 43% increase in unemployment by 2009).

    - Of all countries in this table, Nigeria has lowest Life Expectancy, just a smudge above 50 years. 
      Note, the next two are also African countries.

    - North America has the highest average GDP per capita from a continental perspective, however no North 
      American countries make the top 3 list for countries with highest GDP per capita, which Europe dominates. 
      
    - Interestingly, Europe also has the most countries that severely worsened both post the 2008 GFC and post 
      COVID-19, indicative of slight instability and high variability. Possibly even abnormal distribution of wealth.
