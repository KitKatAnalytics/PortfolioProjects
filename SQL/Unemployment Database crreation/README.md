Above is my first MySQL project and one I had a lot of fun with. It encapsulates a database I created by hand and my subsquent intial exploratory 
analysis as well as a thorough exploration of any interesting trends I could find (loads). The script includes an array of comments for reasoning for
certain functions/code and more importantly, the findings extracted from that code. I also managed to formualte an EER diagram that highlights the 
relationships between all created tables. A similar task was done using PostgreSQL howvere due to the very similar nature of MySQL and PostgreSQL, it is 
not included. 

Interesting Insights:

  - Using only Unemplyoment rate and comparison to contential average GDP, Bahrain has performed most admirably.
 
  - Europe is the only continent that expereinced a reduction/improvement in Unemployment from 2015-2020.

  - 80% of countries in this data table experienced worsened Unemployment post the 2008 GFC, with Denmark leading the way (a =n almost 43% increase in 
    unemployment by 2009.

  - Of all countries in this table, Nigeria has lowest Life Expectancy, just a smudge above 50 years. Note, the next two are also African countries.

  - North America has the highest average GDP per capita from a continent perspective, however no North American countries make the top 3 list for 
    countries with highest GDP per capita, which Europe dominates. Interestingly, Europe also has the most countries that severly worsened both 
    post the 2008 GFC and post COVID-19, indicative of slight instability and high variability. Possibly even abnormal distributoin of wealth.
