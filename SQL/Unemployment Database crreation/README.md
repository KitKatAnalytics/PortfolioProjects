Above is my first MySQL project and one I had a lot of fun with. It encapsulates a database I created by hand and my subsquent intial exploratory 
analysis as well as a thorough exploration of any interesting trends I could find (loads). The script includes an array of comments for reasoning for
certain functions/code and more importantly, the findings extracted from that code. I also managed to formualte an EER diagram that highlights the 
relationships between all created tables. A similar task was done using PostgreSQL howvere due to the very similar nature of MySQL and PostgreSQL, it is 
not included.
