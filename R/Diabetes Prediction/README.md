Above is a machine learning project that aimed to predict Diabetes in women, a condition that effects far too many women. It begins with an intial 
data cleaning process to fix issues in the data, and then a thorough exploration into aspects of the data. It culminated in an examination of 
important parameters for diabetes diagnosis prediction, as well as the formulation of two models, one a generalised linear model, and the other
implementing K-Nearest neighbours, to predict diabetes frequency ina training set. The highest accuracy achieved was 83%, a great level considering the
baseline accuracy of 68%

Interesting Insights:

    - The number of pregnancies is fairly significantly correlated to diabetes in what is known as Gestational 
      Diabetes (had no idea this existed).
    
    - Around a third of women in data set had tested positive for Diabetes at the time of data collection.
    
    - Significant indicators of Diabetes include glucose concentration, BMI, diabetes pedigree function, and 
      number of pregnancies.
    
    - BMI is much less significant of an indicator than I had thought, with a Pearson coefficient of 0.043 
      (close proximity to significance level).
    
    - Insulin negatively correlated to both number of pregnancies and blood pressure.

Recommendations:

    - Essential to educate the public (not just women) about the significant risk factors for diabetes and 
      encourage a healthier lifestyle and diet that ensures stability in levels of blood pressure and glucose.
      
    - Regular check-ups post 20 years old, especially when risk factors are prevalent, can help in 
      early detection and subsequent treatment of condition. 
      
    - As women have more pregnancies, they should consider monitoring blood glucose levels regularly.
    
    - Holistic increase in research conducted in understanding the additional genetic and environmental factors  
      connected to diabetes prognosis, a requirement to effective treatment strategy development, and
      possibly even prevention.
